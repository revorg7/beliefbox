The project's main aim is to support a Bayesian
framework for reinforcement learning.

Directories:

dat/                 - data 
dat/r1e7.bin         - random bits, useful for consistent PSR runs

src/                 - source code

src/algorithms/      - algorithms for reinforcement learning
src/core/            - miscellaneous routines used elsewhere
src/environments/    - test benches
src/geometry/        - anything pertaining to geometry goes here
src/models/          - models of processes, used by algorithms
src/statistics/      - RNGs, distributions, used by models or algorithms
src/tests/           - test code

An algorithm in algorithms/ may use classes from the models/
directory.  Models may use statistics or algorithms for
implementation.

Environments should have the ability to create a full MDP or POMDP model
(if not, an approximate one could be built via simulation perhaps).

Currently, statistical models of MDPs are included in models rather
than in statistics, although the remains of an earlier effort are
there.

A few useful RL algorithms are arleady implmented in algorithms/

Most of the top-level src/ directories also have a subdirectory called
tests/ which is used for one of

       a) regression testing
       b) experimental test benches
       c) prototyping new algorithms.
