1. Introduction
---------------

The project's main aim is to support a Bayesian framework for
reinforcement learning. For this reason, most of the documentation
is generated via Doxygen. 

1.1. File organisation
----------------------

Directories:

dat/                 - data 
dat/r1e7.bin         - random bits, useful for consistent PSR runs

src/                 - source code

src/algorithms/      - algorithms for reinforcement learning
src/core/            - miscellaneous routines used everywhere else
src/environments/    - test benches for algorithms
src/geometry/        - anything pertaining to geometry goes here
src/models/          - models of processes, used by algorithms
src/statistics/      - RNGs, distributions, used by models or algorithms
src/tests/           - test code

An algorithm in algorithms/ may use classes from the models/
directory.  Models may use statistics or algorithms for
implementation.

Environments can have the ability to create an analytical MDP or POMDP model
(if not, an approximate one could be built via simulation perhaps).

Currently, statistical models of MDPs are included in src/models/ rather
than in src/statistics/, although the remains of an earlier effort are
there.

Algorithms for reinforcement learning are arleady implemented in src/algorithms/

Most of the top-level src/ directories also have a subdirectory called
tests/ which is used for three purposes:

       a) regression/unit testing
       b) experimental test benches
       c) prototyping new algorithms.

2. Compilation
--------------

2.1. Requirements
-----------------

GSL (GNU Scientific Library), including development packages.
Optionally, ATLAS, including development packages.

2.2. Compiling the library
--------------------------

In the top directory do:

a) Choose your compiler:

For GCC:
cp src/Make-gcc.mk src/Make-default.mk  

For LLVM/CLANG:
cp src/Make-clang.mk src/Make-default.mk

(b) make clean

(c) make

2.3. Compiling test programs
----------------------------

Tests and example programs are available all directories named:

src/*/tests

To compile an example program called src/foo/tests/blah.cc you need to cd to src/foo/tests/ and type 'make blah'.

EXAMPLE

cd src/algorithms/tests
make online_algorithms
./bin/online_algorithms


3. Generating API documentation
-------------------------------

At the top level directory, type:

doxygen


4. TODO
-------

4.1. implement rl-glue backend
4.2. improve documentation (ongoing)
4.3. remove marginally useful code (ongoing)
4.4. replace all matrix / vector routines with GSL/BLAS (in progress)
