1. Introduction
---------------

The project's main aim is to support a Bayesian framework for
reinforcement learning.

Directories:

dat/                 - data 
dat/r1e7.bin         - random bits, useful for consistent PSR runs

src/                 - source code

src/algorithms/      - algorithms for reinforcement learning
src/core/            - miscellaneous routines used elsewhere
src/environments/    - test benches
src/geometry/        - anything pertaining to geometry goes here
src/models/          - models of processes, used by algorithms
src/statistics/      - RNGs, distributions, used by models or algorithms
src/tests/           - test code

An algorithm in algorithms/ may use classes from the models/
directory.  Models may use statistics or algorithms for
implementation.

Environments should have the ability to create a full MDP or POMDP model
(if not, an approximate one could be built via simulation perhaps).

Currently, statistical models of MDPs are included in src/models/ rather
than in src/statistics/, although the remains of an earlier effort are
there.

A few useful RL algorithms are arleady implemented in src/algorithms/

Most of the top-level src/ directories also have a subdirectory called
tests/ which is used for three purposes:

       a) regression/unit testing
       b) experimental test benches
       c) prototyping new algorithms.

2. Compilation
--------------

In the top directory do:

a) Choose your compiler:

For GCC:
cp src/Make-gcc.mk src/Make-default.mk  

For LLVM/CLANG:
cp src/Make-clang.mk src/Make-default.mk

(b) make clean

(c) make

2.1. Compiling test programs
----------------------------

Tests and example programs are available all directories named:

src/*/tests

To compile an example program called src/foo/tests/blah.cc you need to cd to src/foo/tests/ and type 'make blah'.

EXAMPLE

cd src/algorithms/tests
make online_algorithms
./bin/online_algorithms


3. Generating documentation
---------------------------

At the top level directory, type:

doxygen


4. TODO
-------

4.1. implement rl-glue backend
4.2. improve documentation
4.3. remove marginally useful code
